# discord-modmail
A light weight and simple Discord mod mail bot.

Now, you might be wondering, why is this Mod Mail bot better than the others?

I think this Mod Mail bot is better than the others because it is very light weight and simple. Less than 150 lines and has all the key features of other bots. It is a lot easier to modify because the code is so simple that even a baby could read it! 

## How to self-host:  
1. Install [Python](https://www.python.org/), [Pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/).
2. Install the [nextcord](https://pypi.org/project/nextcord/) and [Python-Dotenv](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/) modules.
3. In the terminal or command prompt run `git clone https://github.com/yavda1/discord-modmail` and then `cd discord-modmail`.
4. Open the `main.py` file in any code/text editor and change lines 17 and 44 with your respective guild and channel IDs.
5. Open the `.env` file in any code/text editor and put your bots token.
5. Run `python3 main.py`.

## What are the commands?

Each command is a discord application or `/` command for ease of use.

`/message [content] [user]` this command sends any message to any user.

`/ignore [user]` this command stops any user from using Mod Mail. This can be used if the user is spamming.

`/unignore [user]` this command unignores the user and allows them to use Mod Mail again.
